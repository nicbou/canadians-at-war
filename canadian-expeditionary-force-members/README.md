# Personnel Records of the Canadian Expediationary Force

Fetches, parses and saves the list of soldiers enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary
Force during the First World War.

## Good to know

* Birth dates have a completely arbitrary format. A custom parser was written to make sense of the
  supplied dates. Even if you DO manage to parse the date, it is not always 100% reliable.
* There are several duplicates in the records. Some of them have differing information, even if it
  concerns the same person. This can be because of several enlistment attempts, document processing
  mistakes and other factors.
