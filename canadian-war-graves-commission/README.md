# Commonwealth War Graves Commission war dead

Fetches, parses and saves the list of war dead from the Commonwealth War Graves
Commission.

## Good to know

* The spelling for first and last names might differ from those of the Canadian
  Expeditionary Force data set.
* "War dead" does not necessarily imply that the person died during the war, or
  from combat action. These records simply provide details about the war graves
  managed by the CWGC.
